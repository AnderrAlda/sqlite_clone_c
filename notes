- I will be writing an sqlLite clone instead of a mySQL or PostgreSQL clone because it is more simple.

- The entire database will be stored in a single file.


- A query goes through a chain of components in order to retrieve or modify data. The front-end consists of the:

	- tokenizer
	- parser
	- code generator

- The input to the front-end is a SQL query. the output is sqlite virtual machine bytecode (essentially a compiled program that can operate on the database).

The back-end consists of the:

	- virtual machine
	- B-tree
	- pager
	- os interface




MAKING A SIMPLE REPL (read-execute-print loop)
- Sqlite starts a read-execute-print loop when you start it from the command line


MAKINIG A SIMPLE SQL COMPILER AND VIRTUAL MACHINE
- sqlite is a SQL compiler that parses a string and outputs an internal representation called bytecode. This bytecode is passed to the virtual machine, which executes it.
